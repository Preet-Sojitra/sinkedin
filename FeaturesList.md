## Feature Ideas

> Need to refine these ideas and prioritize over different stages

1. Failure Posts (The Main Feed)
    - Users can attach memes, GIFs, or screenshots (e.g., a brutal rejection email).
2. SinkedIn Badges
    - Users earn comedic badges for their failures, like “Ghosted Guru” (5+ ignored applications), “Cover Letter Catastrophe” (shared a cringey letter), or “Interview Imploder” (bombed an interview).
    - Badges display on profiles, gamifying the misery.
3. Roast Reactions
    - Instead of “Like” or “Celebrate,” reactions are snarky: “Oof,” “Been There,” “Savage,” or “Cringe.”
    Users can comment with witty one-liners or pile on the roast.
4. An AI bot that automatically generates roast comments based on the post content. (**Sinkedin Official Profile**: It will automatically comment on every post.)
5. Anonymous Mode
    - Users can post anonymously to share juicy fails without tanking their professional rep.
    - Toggle between public and anonymous profiles.
6. Profile Basics ("Failure Résumés" / "Wall of Shame")
    - Simple profiles: username, optional bio, badges earned, and a “Biggest L” section where users summarize their worst career fail.
    - No resumes, no skills lists—just a place to flex your flops.
7. "Severity Score" / "Disaster Scale": Users can optionally rate their fuckup on a scale of 1-10 (1 = "Spilled coffee on resume," 10 = "Accidentally CC'd CEO on email calling them a muppet").
8. "Rejection Bingo": A bingo card with common rejection phrases ("not a good fit," "decided to move forward with other candidates," "will keep your resume on file"). Users can mark them off.
9. "Worst Rejection Letter" of the Week/Month: A contest. Anonymized, of course.
10. "Epic Fail Story Time" (Audio/Video snippets later): For those who can dramatically narrate their downfall.
11. The 'At Least I'm Not That Guy/Gal'" Highlight: A curated section of the most spectacularly awful (but funny) failures.
12. Gamification (Subtle):
    - Badges: "Survived 10 Rejections," "Interview Implosion Expert," "King/Queen of Typos."
    - Leaderboards (anonymous/pseudonymous): "Most 'F's Given/Received," "Most Spectacular Failure (by votes/reactions)."
13. Anti-Motivational Quotes: Daily or weekly "wisdom" like:
    - "It's always darkest before it goes completely black."
    - "If at first you don't succeed, failure may be your style."
    - "The light at the end of the tunnel has been turned off due to budget cuts."
14. "Burn Book" Section (Careful with this one): Anonymized stories about terrible interviewers, bosses, or companies. Needs VERY careful moderation to avoid legal issues and becoming purely vindictive. Maybe focus on types of bad experiences rather than naming names.
15. "Misery Loves Company" Matching
    - Match users with similar disasters
16. "Karma Bounce"
    - When you get rejected/fail, you get "Bounce Credits"
    - Use credits to boost your posts higher in feed
    - The more you fail, the more visibility you get
17. Monetization Ideas:
    - Pay premimum to use less features (ironic, right?)
    - "Premium Shame": Pay to pin your disasters
    - "Roast Me" Feature: Pay to get a personalized roast from the community
    - Sponsored content from companies looking for "resilient" candidates (ironic, right?)
    - Merchandise: T-shirts, mugs with the best failure quotes or memes
18. Automatic username generation based on failure themes for anonymous users when they create an account.
19. "Toxic Positivity" Filter:
    - Automatically flags posts that sound too cheerful. Posts like “Keep grinding 💪” get auto-trashed.
20. Chrome Extension:
    - Replace LinkedIn motivational posts with SinkedIn posts.
21. DM Roulette:
    - Connect randomly with someone who also got rejected today.
22. Failure of the Day Email Digest:
    - Daily email with the funniest fail from the previous day, plus a motivational quote that’s actually demotivational.
23. **Load Feed in Chunks**: Infinite scroll for a smoother experience.
24. **Edit Profile**: User can edit their profile with a username, bio, and profile picture.
