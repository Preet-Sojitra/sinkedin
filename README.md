## Temporary Flow:
1. Maybe a simple landing page?
2. Signup with email/password or social login. (UI idea: Split screen in two parts. Right side: form, left side: logo and other stuffs or something. Also terms and conditions, privacy policy, etc. Left side also caution text about the nature of the platform, e.g., "This is a space for sharing your job market fails in a humorous way. Expect snark, memes, and a lot of roasting. If you can't handle that, this isn't the place for you.")
3. Simple profile setup
   1. Can opt for skip for now (This will set default profile)
4. Or can start as anonymous user posting directly to the feed.

## Feature Ideas

1. Failure Posts (The Main Feed)
    - Users post short, witty stories about their job market fails: ghosted interviews, botched cover letters, or that time they accidentally sent a meme to a recruiter.
    - Users can attach memes, GIFs, or screenshots (e.g., a brutal rejection email).
2. SinkedIn Badges
    - Users earn comedic badges for their failures, like ‚ÄúGhosted Guru‚Äù (5+ ignored applications), ‚ÄúCover Letter Catastrophe‚Äù (shared a cringey letter), or ‚ÄúInterview Imploder‚Äù (bombed an interview).
    - Badges display on profiles, gamifying the misery.
3. Roast Reactions
    - Instead of ‚ÄúLike‚Äù or ‚ÄúCelebrate,‚Äù reactions are snarky: ‚ÄúOof,‚Äù ‚ÄúBeen There,‚Äù ‚ÄúSavage,‚Äù or ‚ÄúCringe.‚Äù
    Users can comment with witty one-liners or pile on the roast.
4. An AI bot that automatically generates roast comments based on the post content.
5. Anonymous Mode
    - Users can post anonymously to share juicy fails without tanking their professional rep.
    - Toggle between public and anonymous profiles.
6. Profile Basics ("Failure R√©sum√©s" / "Wall of Shame")
    - Simple profiles: username, optional bio, badges earned, and a ‚ÄúBiggest L‚Äù section where users summarize their worst career fail.
    - No resumes, no skills lists‚Äîjust a place to flex your flops.
7. "Severity Score" / "Disaster Scale": Users can optionally rate their fuckup on a scale of 1-10 (1 = "Spilled coffee on resume," 10 = "Accidentally CC'd CEO on email calling them a muppet").
8. "Rejection Bingo": A bingo card with common rejection phrases ("not a good fit," "decided to move forward with other candidates," "will keep your resume on file"). Users can mark them off.
9. "Worst Rejection Letter" of the Week/Month: A contest. Anonymized, of course.
10. "Epic Fail Story Time" (Audio/Video snippets later): For those who can dramatically narrate their downfall.
11. The 'At Least I'm Not That Guy/Gal'" Highlight: A curated section of the most spectacularly awful (but funny) failures.
12. Gamification (Subtle):
    - Badges: "Survived 10 Rejections," "Interview Implosion Expert," "King/Queen of Typos."
    - Leaderboards (anonymous/pseudonymous): "Most 'F's Given/Received," "Most Spectacular Failure (by votes/reactions)."
13. Anti-Motivational Quotes: Daily or weekly "wisdom" like:
    - "It's always darkest before it goes completely black."
    - "If at first you don't succeed, failure may be your style."
    - "The light at the end of the tunnel has been turned off due to budget cuts."
14. "Burn Book" Section (Careful with this one): Anonymized stories about terrible interviewers, bosses, or companies. Needs VERY careful moderation to avoid legal issues and becoming purely vindictive. Maybe focus on types of bad experiences rather than naming names.
15. "Misery Loves Company" Matching
    - Match users with similar disasters
16. "Karma Bounce"
    - When you get rejected/fail, you get "Bounce Credits"
    - Use credits to boost your posts higher in feed
    - The more you fail, the more visibility you get
17. Monetization Ideas:
    - Pay premimum to use less features (ironic, right?)
    - "Premium Shame": Pay to pin your disasters
    - "Roast Me" Feature: Pay to get a personalized roast from the community
    - Sponsored content from companies looking for "resilient" candidates (ironic, right?)
    - Merchandise: T-shirts, mugs with the best failure quotes or memes
18. Automatic username generation based on failure themes for anonymous users when they create an account.
19. "Toxic Positivity" Filter:
    - Automatically flags posts that sound too cheerful. Posts like ‚ÄúKeep grinding üí™‚Äù get auto-trashed.
20. Chrome Extension:
    - Replace LinkedIn motivational posts with SinkedIn posts.
21. DM Roulette:
    - Connect randomly with someone who also got rejected today.
22. Failure of the Day Email Digest:
    - Daily email with the funniest fail from the previous day, plus a motivational quote that‚Äôs actually demotivational.
