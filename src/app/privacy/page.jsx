          Welcome to Sinkedin's Privacy Policy. If you're reading this, you're
          either very thorough, very bored, or very paranoid. Good news for the
          paranoid: privacy (or at least, obscurity through anonymity) is kind
          of our jam. This policy explains what little data we bother to collect
          and how we pretend to protect it.
        </p>

        <SectionTitle>
          1. Information We "Collect" (If You Can Call It That)
        </SectionTitle>
        <p>
          We're not Big Brother. We're more like that weird cousin who remembers
          your most embarrassing moments.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <ListItem>
            <strong>Account Info (Optional & Minimal):</strong> If you sign up,
            maybe an email address (use a burner, we don't care) and a witty
            pseudonym. Your real name? We actively discourage it. Why would you?
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            <strong>Your Epic Fail Posts:</strong> The glorious content you
            share. That's the whole point. It's public (within Sinkedin,
            anyway). Duh.
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            <strong>Usage Data:</strong> Standard web server logs â€“ IP
            addresses, browser type, pages visited. Mostly to see if the site is
            on fire (metaphorically, more than usual) or if anyone actually uses
            that one obscure feature.
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            <strong>Cookies:</strong> Tiny digital crumbs. See below. We try not
            to make them too fattening for your browser.
          </ListItem>
        </ul>

        <SectionTitle>2. How We Use Your... Misery Data</SectionTitle>
        <p>We use this "data" for highly sophisticated purposes:</p>
        <ul>
          <ListItem>
            To run Sinkedin and let you share and view failures. Groundbreaking,
            we know.
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            To (maybe, one day) show "trending fuckups" or "most relatable
            rejections."
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            To ensure you're not a bot trying to sell us extended car warranties
            disguised as a layoff story.
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            We are NOT in the business of selling your data. Who would buy this?
            And what would they even do with "Man Fails Job Interview
            Spectacularly #7892"?
          </ListItem>
        </ul>

        <SectionTitle>
          3. Anonymity & Pseudonymity: Your Best Friends
        </SectionTitle>
        <p>
          This is the core of Sinkedin. We WANT you to be anonymous or
          pseudonymous.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <ListItem>
            Don't use your real name unless you enjoy professional
            self-sabotage.
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            Consider a VPN if you're truly dedicated to the art of obscure
            failure-sharing.
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            The less identifiable information you provide, the better. We don't
            want it. You don't want us to have it. It's a win-win.
          </ListItem>
        </ul>

        <SectionTitle>4. Cookies (Not the Tasty Kind)</SectionTitle>
        <p>Yes, we use cookies. They're mostly for:</p>
        <ul>
          <ListItem>
            Keeping you logged in (if you bother to create an account).
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            Remembering your preferences (like if you prefer your daily dose of
            despair extra dark).
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            Basic site functionality. You can block them, but the site might act
            even more broken than intended.
          </ListItem>
        </ul>

        <SectionTitle>
          5. Third-Party Services (The Necessary Evils)
        </SectionTitle>
        <p>We might use some third-party services for things like:</p>
        <ul>
          <ListItem>
            Analytics (to see if more than 3 people are visiting).
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            Hosting (because these stories have to live somewhere on the
            internet's grimy underbelly).
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            We'll try to choose services that respect privacy, or at least
            pretend to as well as we do.
          </ListItem>
        </ul>

        <SectionTitle>
          6. Data Security (Or, "Our Best Effort, Which Isn't Saying Much")
        </SectionTitle>
        <p>
          We take reasonable measures to protect your information, like using
          HTTPS. But let's be honest, if highly skilled hackers are determined
          to steal your anonymous story about accidentally CC'ing your boss on a
          rant email, the world has bigger problems. Don't post state secrets
          here. Or your bank details. Or anything genuinely sensitive that isn't
          already a hilarious career failure.
        </p>

        <SectionTitle>
          7. Children's Privacy (Seriously, Kids, Go Play Outside)
        </SectionTitle>
        <p>
          Sinkedin is not intended for individuals under the age of 18 (or
          whatever the legal age is for appreciating soul-crushing corporate
          humor in your jurisdiction). If you're a kid, please don't use this
          site. Go fail at something fun, like skateboarding.
        </p>

        <SectionTitle>
          8. Changes to This Policy (When We Feel Like It)
        </SectionTitle>
        <p>
          We might update this Privacy Policy. We'll post changes here. Or we
          might forget. Check back if you're really invested. Which would be
          weird.
        </p>

        <p className="text-sm text-light-secondary text-center font-bold">
          **MEGA IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER (AGAIN, BECAUSE LAWYERS):**
        </p>
        <p className="text-xs text-light-secondary text-center italic mb-4">
          Just like our Terms of Service, this Privacy Policy is a work of
          satire. It's meant to be humorous and reflect the spirit of Sinkedin.
          It is NOT a legally compliant Privacy Policy. If you need a real
          Privacy Policy for your own project, consult a legal professional who
          actually knows what they're doing. Seriously, don't use this as a
          template for anything important. We take no responsibility for your
          poor life choices. That's what Sinkedin is for *sharing*, not
          *creating more of*.
