          Welcome to Sinkedin ("us," "we," "the dumpster fire," or
          "Sinkedin.app")! This is where careers come to get a reality check,
          and epic fails get the spotlight they deserve. By accessing or using
          our magnificent platform of professional mishaps, you agree to be
          bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of these terms,
          then please, for the love of all that is holy, go back to LinkedIn.
        </p>

        <SectionTitle>
          1. Your Acceptance (Or, "You're Stuck With Us Now")
        </SectionTitle>
        <p>
          By creating an account or even just lurking, you're saying "Yes, I
          accept these beautifully crafted, not-at-all-serious terms." If you're
          using Sinkedin on behalf of an organization that also enjoys a good
          laugh at failure, they accept these terms too.
        </p>

        <SectionTitle>2. Content - Your Glorious Failures</SectionTitle>
        <p>
          You are responsible for the tales of woe, interview horror stories,
          and general career catastrophes you post ("User Content"). You own it.
          You live it. You (hopefully anonymously) share it.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <ListItem>
            You grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to
            display your User Content on Sinkedin. Basically, so others can
            revel in your misery.
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            Don't post illegal stuff. Don't post copyrighted stuff that ain't
            yours. Don't post your boss's home address (no matter how much they
            deserve it).
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            We can remove content if it's truly vile, breaks laws, or just bores
            us. Our platform, our rules. Mostly, we're here for the laughs, not
            the lawsuits.
          </ListItem>
        </ul>

        <SectionTitle>
          3. User Conduct (Or, "Don't Be a Total Jerk")
        </SectionTitle>
        <p>
          We're all here to bond over shared professional pain. Keep it that
          way.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <ListItem>
            Roasting is encouraged. Genuine bullying, hate speech, doxxing, or
            spamming your crypto scam? Instant ban. You'll be sunk deeper than
            your career prospects.

            Impersonating someone to make them look bad is a dick move.
            Impersonating someone to make them look like they achieved something
            on LinkedIn is... well, also a dick move, but that's their problem,
            not ours.
          </ListItem>

            Anonymity is a privilege, not a shield for douchebaggery.

        <SectionTitle>
          4. Account Termination (Or, "You're Fired!")
        </SectionTitle>
        <p>
          We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account if you
          violate these terms, or if your continued presence just brings down
          the overall quality of our carefully curated chaos. You can also
          delete your account anytime you want to escape the void. No hard
          feelings (probably).
        </p>

        <SectionTitle>
          5. Disclaimers (Or, "We Promise Absolutely Nothing")
        </SectionTitle>
        <p>
          Sinkedin is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without any
          warranties, express or implied.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <ListItem>
            We don't guarantee Sinkedin will help you get a job. It might do the
            opposite. Consider it exposure therapy.
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            We don't guarantee the accuracy or hilarity of any user-generated
            content, though we have high hopes.
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            This site is for entertainment. If you take career advice from
            anonymous roasts on the internet, that's on you, champ.
          </ListItem>
        </ul>

        <SectionTitle>
          6. Limitation of Liability (Or, "Don't Sue Us, Bro")
        </SectionTitle>
        <p>
          To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Sinkedin shall not
          be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or
          punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred
          directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other
          intangible losses, resulting from your access to or use of or
          inability to access or use the service. In layman's terms: if using
          Sinkedin makes your life worse, we're sorry, but that's kind of the
          point, isn't it?
        </p>

        <SectionTitle>
          7. Changes to Terms (Or, "We Make the Rules Up As We Go")
        </SectionTitle>
        <p>
          We might change these terms from time to time. If we do, we'll try to
          let you know. Or not. Continued use after changes means you accept the
          new, probably even more ridiculous, terms.

          This document is a parody. It's designed to be funny and fit the theme
          of Sinkedin. It is NOT a legally binding Terms of Service agreement
          drafted by a lawyer. If you're running a real platform and need actual
          legal documents, please hire a qualified legal professional. Don't
          copy this and think you're covered. You're not. You'll get sued. And
          we'll probably post about it on Sinkedin.
